# Cassandra Scelsi's Professional Portfolio 

## Description 

A professional portfolio is an opportunity to showcase my projects to potential employers as one tool to help them evaluate if I possess the skills they are seeking in an employee.  Because I do not have projects to display yet, the portfolio has been built using placeholder text and images.  This portfolio has been a challenge learing to use flexboxes.
